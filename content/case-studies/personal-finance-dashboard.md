## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Expense Tracking & Categorization
```javascript
// Automatic expense categorization
class ExpenseClassifier {
  constructor() {
    this.categories = {
      'food': ['restaurant', 'grocery', 'cafe', 'delivery'],
      'transport': ['uber', 'gas', 'parking', 'metro'],
      'entertainment': ['movie', 'concert', 'game', 'streaming'],
      'utilities': ['electric', 'water', 'internet', 'phone']
    };
  }

  categorizeExpense(description, amount) {
    const normalizedDesc = description.toLowerCase();
    
    for (const [category, keywords] of Object.entries(this.categories)) {
      if (keywords.some(keyword => normalizedDesc.includes(keyword))) {
        return {
          category,
          confidence: this.calculateConfidence(normalizedDesc, keywords),
          suggestedTags: this.generateTags(normalizedDesc)
        };
      }
    }
    
    return { category: 'other', confidence: 0.5, suggestedTags: [] };
  }
}
```

### 2. Interactive Budget Management
```vue
<template>
  <div class="budget-overview">
    <div class="budget-card" v-for="budget in budgets" :key="budget.id">
      <h3>{{ budget.category }}</h3>
      <div class="progress-bar">
        <div 
          class="progress-fill" 
          :style="{ width: `${budget.percentage}%` }"
          :class="getProgressClass(budget.percentage)"
        ></div>
      </div>
      <div class="budget-details">
        <span>${{ budget.spent }} / ${{ budget.limit }}</span>
        <span :class="getRemainingClass(budget.remaining)">
          ${{ budget.remaining }} remaining
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { computed } from 'vue';

const props = defineProps(['budgets']);

const getProgressClass = (percentage) => {
  if (percentage >= 90) return 'progress-danger';
  if (percentage >= 75) return 'progress-warning';
  return 'progress-success';
};

const getRemainingClass = (remaining) => {
  return remaining < 0 ? 'text-red-500' : 'text-green-500';
};
</script>
```

### 3. Financial Analytics Dashboard
```javascript
// Chart.js configuration for financial insights
const createFinancialChart = (data, type) => {
  const config = {
    type: type,
    data: {
      labels: data.labels,
      datasets: [{
        label: 'Expenses',
        data: data.values,
        backgroundColor: generateColors(data.values.length),
        borderWidth: 2,
        borderColor: '#ffffff'
      }]
    },
    options: {
      responsive: true,
      maintainAspectRatio: false,
      plugins: {
        legend: {
          position: 'bottom',
          labels: {
            usePointStyle: true,
            padding: 20
          }
        },
        tooltip: {
          callbacks: {
            label: (context) => {
              const percentage = ((context.raw / data.total) * 100).toFixed(1);
              return `${context.label}: $${context.raw} (${percentage}%)`;
            }
          }
        }
      },
      animation: {
        animateScale: true,
        animateRotate: true
      }
    }
  };

  return new Chart(document.getElementById('financial-chart'), config);
};
```
