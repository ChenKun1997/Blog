# Building Modern Web Apps with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 has brought some exciting new features that make building modern web applications even more enjoyable. In this post, I'll walk through some of the key improvements and how they impact our development workflow.

## App Router Improvements

The App Router continues to evolve, offering better performance and developer experience:

### Server Components by Default

```jsx
// This is a Server Component by default
export default function BlogPost({ params }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>My Blog Post</h1>
      <p>This renders on the server!</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

### Improved Caching

Next.js 15 introduces more granular caching controls, allowing developers to optimize performance at a more detailed level.

## TypeScript Integration

The TypeScript experience has been significantly improved with better type inference and error messages.

## Performance Enhancements

- Faster build times
- Improved bundle optimization
- Better tree shaking

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 15 project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with React applications. The improvements in performance, developer experience, and TypeScript integration make it an excellent choice for modern web development.
